# 💬 AI-Powered ChatBot

An interactive AI ChatBot application built using React, Vite, Bun, and the OpenAI API.
This project demonstrates how to create a modern conversational interface with real-time message flow, intelligent
responses, and elegant UI components.

Users can chat with the bot, ask questions, and receive contextual responses generated by OpenAI’s language model.

### 🚀 Project Overview

This project combines a React + Vite frontend with a Bun + Express backend, powered by the OpenAI API for natural
language interaction.

Key Features:

- Real-time chat interface connected to OpenAI API.
- Modern, responsive UI built with TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui.
- Clean architecture for easy scalability and integration.
- Fast development and runtime environment powered by Bun.

### 🧱 Tech Stack

Frontend (Client):

- React (Vite + TypeScript), TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui, React Query, Axios

Backend (Server):

- Bun – runtime and package manager
- Express.js – REST API framework
- OpenAI API – for chat completions and intelligent responses
- Layered structure: routes → controllers → services → clients

### ▶️ Run the Project Locally

To start both the frontend (React + Vite) and backend (Bun + Express) together, simply run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command uses concurrently to launch both servers in parallel:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3000

Make sure you’ve:

1. Installed dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

2. Configured your .env file

Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_openai_api_key>
```
